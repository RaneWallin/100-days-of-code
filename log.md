# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 11/24/2018

**Today's Progress**: Installed React and create-react-app on my Windows laptop

**Thoughts:** I've been using an Ubuntu laptop for development, but I have a class that requires I use Windows and switching back and forth has gotten tedious. 


### Day 1: 11/25/2018

**Today's Progress**: Brushing up on React using the Modern React with Redux course on Udemy

**Thoughts**: I did this course last year and learned a lot, but I've been focused on Java since then and needed a refresher. I was surprised to find that the course was just updated this month with all new content! I'll work through it again to get my head back into React and JS.
